<h3><a id="_what_is_fleet_server"></a>What is Fleet Server?<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/main/docs/en/ingest-management/fleet/fleet-server.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Fleet Server is a component that connects Elastic Agents to Fleet. It supports
many Elastic Agent connections and serves as a control plane for updating agent
policies, collecting status information, and coordinating actions across
Elastic Agents. It also provides a scalable architecture. As the size of your agent
deployment grows, you can deploy additional Fleet Servers to manage the
increased workload.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows how Elastic Agents communicate with Fleet Server to
retrieve agent policies:</p>

<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
When a new agent policy is created, the Fleet UI saves the policy to
a Fleet index in Elasticsearch.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
To enroll in the policy, Elastic Agents send a request to Fleet Server,
using the enrollment key generated for authentication.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Fleet Server monitors Fleet indices, picks up the new agent policy from
Elasticsearch, then ships the policy to all Elastic Agents enrolled in that policy.
Fleet Server may also write updated policies to the Fleet index to manage
coordination between agents.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Elastic Agent uses configuration information in the policy to collect and send data
to Elasticsearch.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Elastic Agent checks in with Fleet Server for updates, maintaining an open
connection.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
When a policy is updated, Fleet Server retrieves the updated policy from
Elasticsearch and sends it to the connected Elastic Agents.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
To communicate with Fleet about the status of Elastic Agents and the policy
rollout, Fleet Server writes updates to Fleet indices.

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Does Fleet Server run inside of Elastic Agent?</strong></span></p>
<p>Fleet Server is a subprocess that runs inside a deployed Elastic Agent. This means
the deployment steps are similar to any Elastic Agent, except that you enroll the
agent in a special Fleet Server policy. Typically&#8212;&#8203;especially in large-scale
deployments&#8212;&#8203;this agent is dedicated to running Fleet Server as an Elastic Agent
communication host and is not configured for data collection.</p>

<h3><a id="fleet-security-account"></a>Service account<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/main/docs/en/ingest-management/fleet/fleet-server.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Fleet Server uses a service token to communicate with Elasticsearch, which contains
a <code class="literal">fleet-server</code> service account. Each Fleet Server can use its own service
token, and you can share it across multiple servers (not recommended). The
advantage of using a separate token for each server is that you can invalidate
each one separately.</p>
<p>You can create a service token by either using the Fleet UI or the Elasticsearch API.
